Their main purpose is to enforce data integrity üõ°Ô∏è, which means ensuring the data is accurate, consistent, and reliable. By using constraints, you can prevent \"garbage in, garbage out\" scenarios and guarantee that the data adheres to predefined business rules. Instead of relying on application code to validate every data entry, constraints enforce these rules at the database level, ensuring they're always met, no matter how the data is being modified\n",

This is crucial for maintaining data integrity üõ°Ô∏è, as it guarantees that essential information is always present. For example, in an employees table, you'd apply a NOT NULL constraint to the first_name and last_name columns because an employee record is incomplete and not useful without these details. .\n",

It's the cornerstone of entity integrity üîó, which requires that every row in a table can be uniquely and reliably identified.

A NULL value represents an unknown or missing value, and therefore cannot be used to uniquely identify a specific record. The very purpose of the primary key is to provide a non-ambiguous way to reference each row, and NULL values would directly contradict this fundamental principle.\n"
